After the program is started the calculator window appears. To use it click on the buttons of this window with the mouse. 

## About the project
It was my first project with the UI design. So a Xamarin forms design code was made with the help of the certain course. The whole logic was written by myself only. 

## Future scope
My goal now is to make the design more prettier. Probably it can be upgraded with the buttons animation.
